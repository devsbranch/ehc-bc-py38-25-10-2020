'''numbers: are numerical data types that are inbuilt in python these 
include intergers floating point numbers and lomgintergers'''

'''strings: this is a sequence of characters that have the combination of special
symbols,numbers and letters also strings are mutable meaning they can be changed'''

'''lists: are data structures that represent data or used for storing any data
types of variables and information'''

'''tuples: tuples are immutable you cant not change what is on the list,
they are used to check what index or how many times an item oftenly appears'''

'''dictionaries: use keys and values which can be either a number,tuple or string
in dictoinaries keys_mustkeys must have a kind of immutable data type meaning they can not
be changed and usually they are enclosed with curly braces'''
#Solution for question

#solutions for strings

#method_two
#method1 on lists
list_one= [0,0,0,0]
print(list_one)
#method method_two o lists
list_two=[0,0,0]
print(list_two)
#solution on tuples
'''the difference between tuples and list is that list are mutable whilst tuples are immutable'''
#solution on how to create a tuple
'''to create a tuple you craete a variable and assign that varaible to a list of items or objects'''
#solution on sets
'''they are unique they do not store duplicates of items and they can be converted'''
