You can complete the entire course without reconfiguring it. However, reconfiguring the Terminal makes it significantly easier to use.\n",

    "    - I had to search the Git documentation to figure this out. I did a text search for \"message\" on the [git-log page](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#git-log---grep-reflogltpatterngt).

    "### Bypass The Editor With The -m Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "> TIP: If the commit message you're writing is short and you don't want to wait for your code editor to open up to type it out, you can pass your message directly on the command line with the -m flag: `$ git commit -m \"Initial commit\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What To Include In A Commit\n",
    "\n",
    "> I've been telling you what files to create, giving you the content to include, and telling you when you should make commits. But when you're on your own, how do you know what you should include in a commit and when/how often you should make commits?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The goal is that each commit has a single focus. Each commit should record a single-unit change. Now this can be a bit subjective (which is totally fine), but each commit should make a change to just one aspect of the project.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Now this isn't limiting the number of lines of code that are added/removed or the number of files that are added/removed/modified. Let's say you want to change your sidebar to add a new image. You'll probably:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - add a new image to the project files\n",
    "> - alter the HTML\n",
    "> - add/modify CSS to incorporate the new image\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A commit that records all of these changes would be totally fine!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Conversely, a commit shouldn't include unrelated changes - changes to the sidebar and rewording content in the footer. These two aren't related to each other and shouldn't be included in the same commit. Work on one change first, commit that, and then change the second one. That way, if it turns out that one change had a bug and you have to undo it, you don't have to undo the other change too.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The best way that I've found to think about what should be in a commit is to think, \"What if all changes introduced in this commit were erased?\". If a commit were erased, it should only remove one thing.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Don't worry, commits don't get randomly erased.\n",
    ">\n",

    ">\n",
    "> Now, what makes a \"good\" commit message? That's a great question and has been written about a number of times. Here are some important things to think about when crafting a good commit message:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Do\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters)\n",
    "> - do explain what the commit does (not how or why!)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Do not\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - do not explain why the changes are made (more on this below)\n",
    "> - do not explain how the changes are made (that's what git log -p is for!)\n",
    "> - do not use the word \"and\"\n",
    ">   - if you have to use \"and\", your commit message is probably doing too many changes - break the changes into separate commits\n",
    ">   - e.g. \"make the background color pink and increase the size of the sidebar\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The best way that I've found to come up with a commit message is to finish this phrase, \"This commit will...\". However, you finish that phrase, use that as your commit message.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Above all, be consistent in how you write your commit messages!\n",

    "### Globbing Crash Course\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let's say that you add 50 images to your project, but want Git to ignore all of them. Does this mean you have to list each and every filename in the .gitignore file? Oh gosh no, that would be crazy! Instead, you can use a concept called globbing.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters. In the .gitignore file, you can use the following:\n",
    "> ```text\n",
    "> blank lines can be used for spacing\n",
    "> # - marks line as a comment\n",
    "> - - matches 0 or more characters\n",
    "> ? - matches 1 character\n",
    "> [abc] - matches a, b, or c\n",
    "> ** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches\n",
    ">   a/z\n",
    ">   a/b/z\n",
    ">   a/b/c/z\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> So if all of the 50 images are JPEG images in the \"samples\" folder, we could add the following line to .gitignore to have Git ignore all 50 images.\n",

    "### Reset vs Revert\n",
    "\n",
    "> At first glance, resetting might seem coincidentally close to reverting, but they are actually quite different. Reverting creates a new commit that reverts or undos a previous commit. Resetting, on the other hand, erases commits!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **⚠️ Resetting Is Dangerous ⚠️**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You've got to be careful with Git's resetting capabilities. This is one of the few commands that lets you erase commits from the repository. If a commit is no longer in the repository, then its content is gone.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To alleviate the stress a bit, Git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything. To access this content, you'll need to use the git reflog command. Check out these links for more info:\n",

    "### Relative Commit References\n",
    "\n",
    "> You already know that you can reference commits by their SHA, by tags, branches, and the special HEAD pointer. Sometimes that's not enough, though. There will be times when you'll want to reference a commit relative to another commit. For example, there will be times where you'll want to tell Git about the commit that's one before the current commit...or two before the current commit. There are special characters called \"Ancestry References\" that we can use to tell Git about these relative references. Those characters are:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```text\n",
    "> ^ – indicates the parent commit\n",
    "> ~ – indicates the first parent commit\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Here's how we can refer to previous commits:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - the parent commit – the following indicate the parent commit of the current commit\n",
    ">   ```text\n",
    ">   HEAD^\n",
    ">   HEAD~\n",
    ">   HEAD~1\n",
    ">   ```\n",
    "> - the grandparent commit – the following indicate the grandparent commit of the current commit\n",
    ">   ```text\n",
    ">   HEAD^^\n",
    ">   HEAD~2\n",
    ">   ```\n",
    "> - the great-grandparent commit – the following indicate the great-grandparent commit of the current commit\n",
    ">   ```text\n",
    ">   HEAD^^^\n",
    ">   HEAD~3\n",
    ">   ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The main difference between the ^ and the ~ is when a commit is created from a merge. A merge commit has two parents. With a merge commit, the ^ reference is used to indicate the first parent of the commit while ^2 indicates the second parent. The first parent is the branch you were on when you ran git merge while the second parent is the branch that was merged in.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It's easier if we look at an example. This what my git log currently shows:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```text\n",
    "> - 9ec05ca (HEAD -> master) Revert \"Set page heading to \"Quests & Crusades\"\"\n",

    "> The git reset command is used to reset (erase) commits:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> $ git reset <reference-to-commit>\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It can be used to:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - move the HEAD and current branch pointer to the referenced commit\n",
    "> - erase commits\n",
    "> - move committed changes to the staging index\n",
    "> - unstage committed changes\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### Git Reset's Flags\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The way that Git determines if it erases, stages previously committed changes, or unstages previously committed changes is by the flag that's used. The flags are:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - `--mixed`\n",
    "> - `--soft`\n",
    "> - `--hard`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It's easier to understand how they work with a little [animation](https://youtu.be/UN7ki2G2yKc).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### 💡 Backup Branch 💡\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Remember that using the git reset command will erase commits from the current branch. So if you want to follow along with all the resetting stuff that's coming up, you'll need to create a branch on the current commit that you can use as a backup.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Before I do any resetting, I usually create a backup branch on the most-recent commit so that I can get back to the commits if I make a mistake:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `$ git branch backup`\n",
